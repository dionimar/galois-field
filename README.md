Polynomials over Galois Field

The polynomials on the finite fields play a fundamental role for the development of algorithms, especially for encryption.
This project tries to discover the main algorithms about finite fields, trying to emphasize their optimization.
Polynomials have been implemented with a linked list structure:

        Mon--->(next)--->Mon--->(next)--->...--->(next)--->Mon
         ^                                                  ^
         |                                                  |
         |                                                  |
       first                                              last

This implementation does not intend to compete at the professional level in performance: with it we have been able to explore more thoroughly the C ++ language and the implemented algorithms, in addition to its limitations.

If you believe that any part of the code can be useful, feel free to use, modify or publish it.
